# WebScraper
Web Scraper built using Javascript and NodeJS to collect data off websites


## Prerequisites
1. Nodejs


## Setup
1. run 'npm install' in project folder to download external libraries
2. modify Scraper.js to fit your needs e.g. website, looping and data collection.
3. run the Scraper.js file using node.
4. once complete, find the 'export.xlsx' file in the project folder.

multiple instances of this program can be executed but try keep the loop smaller as the file only gets written at the end of the program and you will lose all progress if closed.
